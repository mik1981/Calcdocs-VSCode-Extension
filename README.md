## ⚡ What CalcDocs does

CalcDocs transforms VS Code into a **live firmware calculation explorer**.

Instead of manually expanding macros, opening Excel files, or mentally resolving formulas:

✅ Hover a value  
✅ See the final computed result  
✅ Understand firmware logic instantly

No build.
No flashing.
No debugger.

---

## ⚡ 5-second demo

## 1️⃣ Coding Evaluator

Write this:

```c
#define RPM 1000
#define SPEED (RPM * 0.10472)
```

CalcDocs instantly shows:

```c
#define SPEED (RPM * 0.10472)   ← 104.72
```

✅ Real-time evaluation  
✅ Inline resolved values  
✅ No manual calculations  

---

## 2️⃣ Realtime Engineering Notes

Write this directly inside your firmware comments:

```c
// @rpm = 3000 rpm
// = @rpm -> rad/s
// = 13 N * 1 m * @rpm -> W
```

CalcDocs evaluates everything live:

```c
// @rpm = 3000 rpm
// = @rpm -> rad/s <- 314.1592653589793 rad/s
// = 13 N * 1 m * @rpm -> W <- 4084.0704496667313 W
```

* Realtime calculations directly in comments
* Unit conversion (`rpm -> rad/s`, `atm -> Pa`, etc.)
* Keep formulas near the actual firmware logic
* Eliminate scattered Excel and text notes


---

> Keep engineering calculations close to the firmware logic instead of:
> - Excel sheets
> - random `.txt` files
> - disconnected documentation
>
> Your firmware becomes self-documented.

---

## 3️⃣ Interactive Formula Explorer

Explore firmware formulas as a live dependency graph directly inside VS Code.

CalcDocs keeps formulas and firmware intrinsically synchronized.

The same engineering logic can now:

✅ live next to production code  
✅ be evaluated in real time  
✅ be reused during debugging  
✅ propagate through dependencies automatically  
✅ stay permanently aligned with the firmware implementation  
✅ can also propagate **tolerances** (e.g. `tol`, `min`/`max`) through your YAML formula dependency graph to compute final **min/max ranges**.

No duplicated engineering logic.  
No spreadsheet drift.  
No parallel maintenance.

# 🔥 Why this matters

Firmware development is rarely difficult because of syntax.

It becomes difficult because:

- values are hidden
- formulas are fragmented
- scaling is implicit
- engineering decisions live outside the codebase

Understanding a single value may require:

- opening multiple headers
- expanding macro chains
- checking documentation
- validating unit conversions
- searching old spreadsheets

---

> Most firmware projects suffer from:
> - duplicated formulas
> - stale spreadsheets
> - undocumented scaling
> - hidden assumptions
>
> These issues create real bugs.

---

## CalcDocs removes that friction.

Instead of navigating half the project:

👉 you immediately see what the firmware computes.

---

## 🔗 YAML ↔ C Synchronization

Define formulas once:

```yaml
power:
  formula: vin * current
  unit: W
```

Use them everywhere.

CalcDocs:

✅ evaluates formulas  
✅ syncs YAML with C/C++  
✅ prevents formula drift  
✅ shows results inline  

---

## ⚖️ Built-In Validation

Detect issues early:

- Unit mismatches
- Overflow risks
- Invalid conversions
- YAML/C inconsistencies

---

> CalcDocs is designed for real embedded firmware workflows.

---

## 👀 What it looks like in real code

```c
#define VIN 24
#define CURRENT 2
#define POWER (VIN * CURRENT)
```

CalcDocs shows:

```c
#define POWER (VIN * CURRENT)   ← 48W
```

---

## 💡 Real use cases

### 🔍 Understand code instantly

No more jumping across headers to resolve macros

### ⚠️ Catch bugs early

See wrong values before flashing your MCU

### 🔄 Eliminate Excel drift

Formulas stay aligned with firmware

### 🧪 Debug faster

Know values before runtime

---

## 📚 Create Self-Documenting Firmware

Engineering decisions stay inside the source code.

---

# ❗ What CalcDocs Is NOT

CalcDocs is intentionally focused.

It is:

❌ NOT a compiler  
❌ NOT a debugger  
❌ NOT a full static analyzer  

---

> CalcDocs focuses on one thing:
>
> **making firmware numeric logic visible.**

---

## ⚙️ Recommended setup (optional)

CalcDocs works standalone.

For best results, combine it with:

- `clangd` *(recommended)*
- `ms-vscode.cpptools`
- `CMake Tools`

CalcDocs integrates without conflicts.

---

> CalcDocs supports engineering prefixes automatically:
>
> `mV`, `uV`, `nV`, `kV`, `MHz`, `mA`, etc.

## 🧠 Final thought

Spreadsheets hide logic.
Code hides values.

# **CalcDocs reveals both.**
